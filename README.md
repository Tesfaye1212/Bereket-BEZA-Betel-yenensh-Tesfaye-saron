Project Description
This project involves analyzing a text file to perform various tasks such as identifying words, computing word and character frequencies, and providing statistical information about the text. The tasks include:

Identifying Words: Extract words from the text, removing special characters like semicolons, commas, and full stops to focus on meaningful words.
Word Frequency: Compute the frequency of each word in the text and display the words in decreasing order of their frequency.
Character Frequency: Compute the frequency of each character in the text and display the five most frequently occurring characters.
Statistical Information: Provide statistical information including the total number of lines, total number of words, and total number of characters in the text file.


Functions
clean_text(text)
This function removes special characters from the text and returns the cleaned text.

compute_word_frequency(text)
This function computes and returns a dictionary of word frequencies from the provided text, with words as keys and their frequencies as values. It also prints the words in decreasing order of their frequency.

compute_character_frequency(text)
This function computes and returns a dictionary of character frequencies from the provided text, with characters as keys and their frequencies as values. It also prints the first five most frequently occurring characters.

compute_statistics(text)
This function computes and returns statistical information about the text, including the total number of lines, total number of words, and total number of characters.
